Here in this chapter I am gonna show you how to use the numerical methods in Python. In this chapter we explore a better option: using an ODE solver. ODE solvers are numerical methods that can be used to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of the form:
$$ \frac{dy}{dt} = f(t, y) $$
where \(y\) is the dependent variable, \(t\) is the independent variable, and \(f(t, y)\) is a function that describes the rate of change of \(y\) with respect to \(t\). ODE solvers can be used to solve a wide range of problems in science and engineering, including population dynamics, chemical reactions, and mechanical systems.
