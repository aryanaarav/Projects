# 📊 Project Title: Linear Regression on Boston Housing Data

## 🚀 Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of **Linear Regression Algorithm** using the **Boston Housing Dataset**. The goal is to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes in thousands of dollars based on various features.

---

## 🧠 Algorithm Used
- **Linear Regression**
- Key Idea: To model the relationship between a dependent variable (median home value) and one or more independent variables (features like number of rooms, crime rate, etc.) using a linear equation.

## 📁 Dataset
- **Source**: Kaggle
- **Name**: Boston Housing Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset containing information about housing in Boston, including features such as crime rate, number of rooms, and distance to employment centers, along with the target variable which is the median value of homes.
1. CRIM per capita crime rate by town
2. ZN proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
3. INDUS proportion of non-retail business acres per town
4. CHAS Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
5. NOX nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
6. RM average number of rooms per dwelling
7. AGE proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
8. DIS weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
9. RAD index of accessibility to radial highways
10. TAX full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
11. PTRATIO pupil-teacher ratio by town
12. B 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
13. LSTAT % lower status of the population
14. MEDV Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's
- **Size**: 506 rows × 14 columns
