A structured implementation plan for Vanilla GAN for Handwritten Digit Generation.
The project is organized into several key sections, each with its own purpose and functionality. Below is a detailed description of each section, including the files and their roles in the overall project.
## Project Structure

``` Setup and Importing Libraries```
This section includes the necessary libraries and modules required for the project. It sets up the environment for data loading, model building, training, and evaluation.

``` Data Loading and Preprocessing```
This section is responsible for loading the MNIST dataset, which contains handwritten digits. It includes functions to preprocess the data, such as normalization and reshaping, to prepare it for training the GAN.

``` Model Building```
This section defines the architecture of the Generator and Discriminator models. The Generator creates fake images from random noise, while the Discriminator distinguishes between real and fake images. The models are built using Keras and TensorFlow.

``` Training Loop```
This section contains the main training loop for the GAN. It includes functions to train the Generator and Discriminator, as well as to generate and save images during training. The training process involves alternating between training the Discriminator and the Generator.

``` Evaluation and Visualization```
This section evaluates the performance of the GAN by generating images after each epoch. It includes functions to visualize the generated images and save them for later analysis. The evaluation helps in understanding how well the GAN is learning to generate realistic handwritten digits.
